                <ul>
                    <li><span>Appointment Booking:</span> OIS facilitates the booking of VISA appointments on behalf of customers. Customers are advised to accurately provide all necessary information during the appointment booking process.</li>
                    <li><span>Processing Responsibility:</span> While OIS assists in booking VISA appointments with the NIS, it is important to note that the processing and issuance of the VISA are solely the responsibility of the Nigerian Immigration Service. In all respects, OIS provides non-judgemental services and therefore does not have control over the VISA processing timelines or any decision regarding VISA issuance in any manner whatsoever.</li>
                    <li><span>Processing Times:</span> OIS makes reasonable efforts to provide customers with estimated processing times based on information available from the NIS. However, the actual processing times may vary due to factors beyond OIS's control, such as changes in regulations, volume of applications, individual and or other unforeseen circumstances.</li>
                    <li><span>Information Accuracy:</span> OIS strives to provide accurate and up-to-date information regarding VISA requirements and appointment procedures. However, customers are advised to independently verify the information provided and consult official sources, such as the NIS website, for the most current information.</li>
                    <li><span>Disclaimer of Liability:</span> OIS shall not be held liable for any delays, denials, or other issues arising from the VISA application and processing. OIS's role is limited to facilitating the appointment booking process and conveying customer information to the NIS.</li>
                    <li><span>Indemnification:</span> Users of the OIS website agrees to indemnify and hold OIS harmless from any claims, demands, actions, suits, or proceedings arising from or related to the VISA application process.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                While OIS endeavours to provide a seamless and efficient appointment booking experience, it is important for users to understand that the Nigerian Immigration Service is solely responsible for VISA processing, including processing times, decisions, and issuance. Users are encouraged to exercise due diligence and seek official information from the NIS regarding VISA processing.
