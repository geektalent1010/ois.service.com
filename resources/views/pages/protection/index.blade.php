                            There are six alternative ways in which the lawfulness of a specific case of processing of
                            personal data may be established under the GDPR. It is OIS policy to identify the
                            appropriate basis for processing and to document it, in accordance with the Regulation. The
                            options are described in brief in the following sections.
                        </p>

                            Unless it is necessary for a reason allowable in the GDPR, OIS will always obtain explicit
                            consent from a data subject to collect and process their data. In case of children below the
                            age of 16 (a lower age may be allowable in specific EU member states) parental consent will
                            be obtained. Transparent information about our usage of their personal data will be provided
                            to data subjects at the time that consent is obtained and their rights with regard to their
                            data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent. This information will be provided in
                            an accessible form, written in clear language and free of charge. If the personal data are
                            not obtained directly from the data subject then this information will be provided to the
                            data subject within a reasonable period after the data are obtained and definitely within
                            one month.

                            contract cannot be completed without the personal data in question e.g. a delivery cannot be
                            made without an address to deliver to.

                            processing. OIS will retain reasonable, documented evidence that this is the case, whenever
                            this reason is used as the lawful basis of the processing of personal data. As an example,
                            this may be used in aspects of social care, particularly in the public sector.

                            principles are set out in schedule 1 of the Act and are as follows:

                            physically and technically. The areas where personal data are kept are out of bounds for all
                            non-authorised persons. Access to these parts of the premises can only be gained by
                            electronic key issued only to authorised persons. Your personal data can only be accessed on
                            the system by authorised persons. Only such authorised persons can alter, disclose or
                            destroy your personal data. Further, such authorised persons can only carry out any of those
                            functions in the course of their lawful duties. Therefore, the chances of your personal data
                            being unlawfully processed or accidentally damaged, destroyed or lost are very minimal.
                            Further, it is our policy to ensure that:

                                we discourage personal data being stored on laptops and other mobile devices and media
                                but if they do, should be locked securely and not taken out of the office.

                            viii. Transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area<br>Your personal data
                            will not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless
                            that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and
                            freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. There are only few
                            counties outside the EEA that have been accepted as having adequate levels of protection for
                            the processing of persona data comparable to the EEA countries. When we are transferring
                            personal data to the USA, we ensure that the recipient is a signatory to the US Department
                            of Commerce Safe Harbour Scheme. This scheme is recognised by the European Commission as
                            providing adequate protection for data subjects. In relation to other countries outside the
                            EEA that have not been accepted as having equivalent security and safeguards in place for
                            processing personal data, we either sign a separate contract, the terms of which are
                            approved by the European Directives or ensure that there is a clause in the contract that
                            protects the processing of personal data of all our clients.
